# jooq-bug
A repository to help demonstrate bugs with jooq

## How to run?

I have been running this by running the main method found in `PostgresJsonSelectBug.kt` using the gutter icon in Intellij. If not using Intellij then you'll want to build using `./gradlew build` and then run the main method from the built jar.
